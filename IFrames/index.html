            <p>
                I'm at a payphone trying to call home<br>
                All of my change I spent on you<br>
                Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong<br>
                Where are the plans we made for two<br>
                <br>
                Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember<br>
                The people we used to be<br>
                It's even harder to picture<br>
                That you're not here next to me<br>
                You said it's too late to make it<br>
                But is it too late to try?<br>
                And in our time that you wasted<br>
                All of our bridges burned down<br>
                <br>
                I've wasted my nights<br>
                You turned out the lights<br>
                Now I'm paralyzed<br>
                Still stuck in that time when we called it love<br>
                But even the sun sets in paradise<br>
                <br>
                I'm at a payphone trying to call home<br>
                All of my change I spent on you<br>
                Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong<br>
                Where are the plans we made for two<br>
                <br>
                If happy ever after did exist<br>
                I would still be holding you like this<br>
                All those fairy tales are full of shit<br>
                One more fucking love song I'll be sick<br>
                <br>
                You turned your back on tomorrow<br>
                Cause you forgot yesterday<br>
                I gave you my love to borrow<br>
                But you just gave it away<br>
                You can't expect me to be fine<br>
                I don't expect you to care<br>
                I know I've said it before<br>
                But all of our bridges burned down<br>
                <br>
                I've wasted my nights<br>
                You turned out the lights<br>
                Now I'm paralyzed<br>
                Still stuck in that time when we called it love<br>
                But even the sun sets in paradise<br>
                <br>

                Man fuck that shit<br>
                I'll be out spending all this money while you sitting round<br>
                Wondering why wasn't you who came up from nothing<br>
                Made it from the bottom<br>
                Now when you see me I'm strutting<br>
                And all of my cars start with a push of a button<br>
                Telling me the chances I blew up<br>
                Or whatever you call it<br>
                Switched the number to my phone<br>
                So you never could call it<br>
                Don't need my name on my show<br>
                You can tell it I'm ballin'<br>
                Swish, what a shame could have got picked<br>
                Had a really good game but you missed your last shot<br>
                So you talk about who you see at the top<br>
                Or what you could have saw<br>
                But sad to say it's over for<br>
                Phantom pulled valet open doors<br>
                Wiz like go away got what you was looking for<br>
                Now it's me who they want<br>
                So you can go and take that little piece of shit with you<br>
                <br>
                I'm at a payphone trying to call home<br>
                All of my change I spent on you<br>
                Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong<br>
